This competition challenges us to make \\\r\n            a robot that can navigate and interact with underwater obstacles without any\\\r\n            human intervention whatsoever. The team was founded in 2017 and is made up of \\\r\n            engineering and computer science students from multiple disciplines who have full\\\r\n            control over the design, manufacturing and testing of the robot. Since becoming\\\r\n            a team, we have learned a lot about designing for the underwater environment and \\\r\n            are continuously improving upon our existing designs. \",\r\n        \"pitch\": {\r\n            \"image\": \"mechanical.jpg\",\r\n            \"header\": \"Why Subbots?\",\r\n            \"body\": \" Subbots provides the chance for students to work on unique design\\\r\n                problems that canât be found anywhere else at UBC.

Combining these two together brings a variety of challenges such \\\r\n                as autonomous underwater navigation, hydrodynamics and buoyancy, electronics \\\r\n                waterproofing, actuation of mechanical systems and many more. Since Subbots is a \\\r\n                relatively new design team, there is plenty of opportunity to improve upon existing\\\r\n                designs and be a part of building the team.

However, by selecting a PD controller and a \\\r\n                        Linear Quadratic Regulator to aid in controller tuning, we could address this constraint using a cost funtion\\\r\n                         which applies a moderate cost to each of our 5 degrees of freedom, and a large cost on the pitch motion.\\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        The controller implementation involves using a path planning algorithm to generate position setpoints and a \\\r\n                        velocity profile for each step, then using a generic feedback model, perform PD control on the desired \\\r\n                        setpoint using the gain values determined by the cost function. \\\r\n                        Using the velocity profile and a thruster transformation matrix, we are able to calculate the force \\\r\n                        contributions by each thruster to achieve the desired trajectory for each iteration of our control loop.\\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        To develop and validate our control system, we first created a Simulink project to test it under \\\r\n                        theoretical conditions.

Using Gazebo, we developed camera, position, gyroscope\\\r\n                         and depth sensor emulators, as well as thruster driver emulators. These emulators interact with our control pipeline \\\r\n                         via ROS2.

One of the key points of our power distribution system is the use of two separate batteries powering the whole \\\r\n                        system. There are a couple of reasons why this separation is necessary. First, there are components that generally are power-heavy, such \\\r\n                        as the thrusters, which usually require more power to run. These components require more powerful batteries, so it makes more sense to connect \\\r\n                        them to a bigger battery, while smaller components such as the pressure sensors connect to a smaller battery. Second, having two separate batteries \\\r\n                        allows us to completely isolate noise. Motors and thrusters usually generate a lot of noise which can interfere with more sensitive signals in the system. \\\r\n                        Our team uses one battery for the noisy and power-heavy components, and the other for sensitive low-power components. The use of optocouplers enables \\\r\n                        electrical isolation between the two batteries because optocouplers have an LED-phototransistor pair which allows us to make voltage references between \\\r\n                        the two batteries without actually physically connecting the two. \\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        Another important component of power distribution is wiring. It is important to ensure that power-heavy components are connected with appropriate wires that \\\r\n                        are able to handle the required current and voltage. For sensitive components, it is important to make the wire connections as short as possible and physically \\\r\n                        distant from power-heavy wires to ensure that the sensitive readings donât pick up noise in the system. Within the main enclosure, components are laid out to \\\r\n                        ensure these types of spacings are possible for all wiring. \",\r\n                        \"carousel\": \r\n                        {\r\n                        \"images\": [\"PowerDistribution.png\"],\r\n                        \"caption\": \"\"\r\n                        },\r\n                    },\r\n                    { \r\n                        \"header\": \"Sound Localization\",\r\n                        \"bodyFull\": \"Shown Above: One of the sound localization architectures we are considering.\\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        In order to locate some of the tasks at Robosub, we are developing a system that will allow us to locate underwater pingers emitting sounds at known frequencies. \\\r\n                        In order to do that, we are designing circuits to process signals coming out of a hydrophone (underwater microphone) and researching a variety of techniques to use \\\r\n                        those signals for localization.

Currently team members are working on testing this design \\\r\n                        in LTSpice, and adding features such as a 12A fuse to act as a kill switch, an LED indicator to notify us quickly if that fuse breaks and more.\\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        Temperature Monitoring: Still in the research phase, the purpose of temperature monitoring is to ensure that the batteries do not overheat and get damaged during operation. This is an especially important \\\r\n                        feature since the robot is underwater, and the batteries are stored in small enclosures. The temperature data that is read electrically will then be sent to a microcontroller and subsequently the robot main \\\r\n                        computer so we can adjust operation if the batteries begin to overheat. Currently team members are researching how to leverage the batteriesâ integrated NTC thermistor to read temperature data.\",\r\n                        \"carousel\": \r\n                        {\r\n                        \"images\": [\"BMS-System.png\"],\r\n                        \"caption\": \"\"\r\n                        },\r\n                    },\r\n                ],\r\n            },\r\n            \"mechanical\": {\r\n                \"header\": \"Mechanical Projects\",\r\n                \"body\": \"With access to in-person workspaces limited during the COVID-era, we have focused primarily \\\r\n                on CAD design, and on figuring out manufacturing techniques for said designs once in-person work is allowed \\\r\n                again.

To complete these tasks additional actuator systems are required. \\\r\n                        One of our actuator systems is a robotic manipulator arm, designed to grip and move various objects. So far, we have designed a 2-degree of freedom arm, with \\\r\n                        an end effector made for gripping.

The arm also utilizes a depth sensor to detect objects within its grasp and a flexible stretch sensor to control the \\\r\n                        gripperâs force. The project itself is still in its early stages, and we are planning on adding more degrees of freedom to the robot to increase the armâs range of \\\r\n                        motion. Some of the tasks of this project include programming inverse/forward kinematics of the robot arm, spec-ing actuators and sensors, performing grip and stress \\\r\n                        tests, analog circuit design for motor driver and sensor circuits and designing future iterations of the arm to include more degrees of freedom. \\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        All other actuator projects are still in the early brainstorming phase, meaning that there are substantial opportunites for new members to contribute ideas and learn about \\\r\n                        the exciting world of underwater actuation.\",\r\n                        \"carousel\": \r\n                        {\r\n                        \"images\": [\"Manipulator_arm_sketch.png\"],\r\n                        },\r\n                    },\r\n                    {\r\n                        \"header\": \"Frames and Hydrodynamics\",\r\n                        \"bodyFull\": \"Shown Above: Triton's frame structure and thruster configuration, Triton's passive stabilization system, and the frame design for our next generation robot.\\\r\n                        <br \\><br \\>\\\r\n                        The bulk of our projects focus on how to make our robot as hydrodynamic and structurally sound while moving through the water.

Unfortunately, this pursuit of a low-cost design \\\r\n                        resulted in a limited number of thrusters being installed. As a result, Triton has 4 degrees of freedom instead of the ideal 6. This was partially dealt with by the addition of a passive \\\r\n                        stability system consisting of bouyant styrofoam (top of robot) and solid ballast (lower section).
